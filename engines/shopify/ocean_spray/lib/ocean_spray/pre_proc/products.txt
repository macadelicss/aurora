Natural Rapport_the Only Doggy Mouthwash Dogs Need
Category - Collections
About this product
Did you know that dogs need oral hygiene just like humans do? Ignoring their teeth and gums can lead to a noxious mouth, causing discomfort and even health issues. That's where Natural Rapport comes in – the only doggy mouthwash your furry friend needs for a clean, healthy mouth.
Doggy Mouthwash may sound like a strange concept, but it's actually a crucial part of your dog's dental care. Just like us, dogs can suffer from plaque and tartar buildup on their teeth.

That's where Natural Rapport comes in – their mouthwash helps clean your dog's teeth and gums without the hassle of brushing.
It's made with Mother Nature's own plaque and tartar fighters, ensuring a cleaner mouth without any harsh chemicals. Plus, it has a refreshing minty flavor that will leave your dog with fresh breath after each use.

Plus, with all-natural and organic ingredients, including certified Kosher hemp sourced from state-licensed farms in Oregon and Colorado, you can trust that you are getting the best of the best. And to top it off, CBD Living Water is proudly made in the USA.
So what exactly is in this magical drink? Along with 10 mg of nano-CBD, the ingredients include purified 9+ pH water, potassium bicarbonate, magnesium sulfate, and potassium hydroxide. Don't worry - all of these ingredients are safe and natural.
But as with any health product, it's important to note that these statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Walking Each Other Home_Conversations on Loving and Dying
Ram Dass & Mirabai Bush
Items - 1
Category: Occasions -> Reading -> Self Help
An intimate dialogue between two friends and luminaries on love, death, and the spiritual path, with guidance for the end-of-life journey

We all sit on the edge of a mystery. We have only known this life, so dying scares us―and we are all dying. But what if dying is perfectly safe? What would it look like if you could approach dying with curiosity and love, in service of other beings? What if dying is the ultimate spiritual practice?

Ram Dass and Mirabai Bush began their friendship more than four decades ago at the foot of their guru, Neem Karoli Baba, also known as Maharaj-ji. He transmitted to them a simple philosophy: love everyone, tell the truth, and give up attachment to material things. A year before Ram Dass passed, he reunited with Bush for an intimate dialogue―which became Walking Each Other Home.

In this extraordinary book, you’ll hear from two beloved teachers about the spiritual opportunities within the dying process. They generously share intimate personal experiences and timeless practices with courage, humor, and heart, gently exploring every aspect of this journey. Here you’ll learn about guidelines for being a “loving rock” for the dying, how to grieve fully and authentically, how to transform a fear of death, leaving a spiritual legacy, creating a sacred space for dying, and much more.

“Everybody you have ever loved is a part of the fabric of your being now,” says Ram Dass. The body may die, but the soul remains. Death is an invitation to a new kind of relationship, in the place where we are all One. Join these two lifelong friends and spiritual luminaries as they explore what it means to live and die consciously, remember who we really are, and illuminate the path we walk together.
